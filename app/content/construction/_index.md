## Turn weather-driven loss of workable days into measurable protection and fast liquidity.

### Weather volatility creates non-workable days and financial loss. Measured, indexed, and paid when thresholds are exceeded.

{% simple_grid(count="3") %}

{% value_card(title="+5% to 15%", subtitle="", icon="trending-up") %}
Increase in total project costs linked to weather stoppages, depending on the stage of works.
{% end %}

{% value_card(title="15% to 40%", subtitle="", icon="thermometer-sun") %}
Reduction in worker productivity during heatwaves and extreme temperatures, impacting timelines and costs.
{% end %}

{% value_card(title="45% of Projects", subtitle="", icon="warning") %}
Construction projects globally are affected by weather disruptions that reduce workable days.
{% end %}

## Two targets. One common problem. One objective index.

{% feature_card(title="Large Projects", subtitle="Project owners & contractors.", icon="building", triggers=["Payout triggers when the number of days above or below agreed thresholds at the project POI exceeds the predefined deductible."], bullets=["Wind thresholds preventing crane lifts.","Rain thresholds preventing concrete pours.","Temperature thresholds preventing works."]) %}
Covers financial loss linked exclusively to weather-driven non-workable days, as measured by an objective meteorological index at the project point of interest.

{% feature_card(title="Equipment Rental", subtitle="Construction equipment rental operators.", icon="target", triggers=["Payout triggers when the annual number of adverse weather days exceeds the predefined deductible, with transparent per-day compensation beyond it."], bullets=["Multi-station daily index using N reference stations and M-trigger logic designed to reflect operational exposure.","Daily allowance paid per adverse weather day beyond the deductible.","Optional exclusion of specific non-working periods depending on the insured activity."]) %}
Protects against periods of non-use caused by adverse weather, measured through an objective daily index over a defined geographical area.

### Three predefined deductible structures translating different weather risk tolerances into transparent parametric coverage. Liquidity is paid after the agreed number of lost days is exceeded.
