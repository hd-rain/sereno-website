Designed to complement traditional insurance, Sereno’s parametric solutions are built to provide :

## Unique weather data expertise

_Reducing basis risk with superior data and proven expertise._

Historical data is no longer enough. Our proprietary algorithms account for climate change trends to price your risk fairly for tomorrow, not yesterday.We don't only rely on generic airport weather stations. We fuse satellite imagery, radar, and IoT sensors to model risk exactly where your assets are.

Backed by a team of experienced meteorologists and climate scientists who continuously validate assumptions, refine models, and ensure scientific rigor at every step.The gap between "weather at the station" and "weather at your site" costs you money. We close that gap.

{% feature_card(title="Portfolio‑level monitoring", subtitle="See the bigger picture.") %}

The platform gives you a clear view across your portfolio:

- Active covers and limits
- Exposure by region or peril
- Events in progress and potential payouts

You gain visibility to support better advice, stronger renewals, and more strategic conversations.

{% end %}

{% feature_card(title="Client‑specific triggers", subtitle="No generic assumptions.") %}

Triggers are designed using your clients’ own exposure data.Thresholds are calibrated to real locations, assets, and risk profiles, ensuring a clear link between:

- The weather event
- The trigger
- The client’s financial exposure

This precision reduces basis risk and builds trust.

{% end %}

{% feature_card(title="Proactive alerts for your clients", subtitle="Stay ahead of climate events.") %}

We monitor weather conditions in real time and send alerts:
When a relevant event is forecasted
As conditions evolve toward predefined thresholds
When thresholds are reached or exceeded
You can inform your clients early and act before impacts materialize.
