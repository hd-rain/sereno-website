## Weather volatility is no longer a nuisance. It is a structural cost.

### _**"Once on demurrage, always on demurrage"**_.

A brutal reality in maritime logistics. A single weather interruption doesn't just pause a clock; it triggers a cascade of delays, vessel queuing, and storage bottlenecks that no spreadsheet can fully anticipate.

While the industry talks about long-term climate change, we focus on **daily climate volatility**.

{% simple_grid(count="3") %}

{% value_card(title="Wind Bursts", subtitle="", icon="wind") %}
Sudden wind bursts that force cranes to stop.
{% end %}

{% value_card(title="Heavy Rainfall", subtitle="", icon="rain") %}
Heavy rainfall that turns bulk cargo into unworkable sludge.
{% end %}

{% value_card(title="Thunderstorms", subtitle="", icon="zap") %}
Thunderstorms that freeze operations for safety.
{% end %}

{% end %}

These events are brief, but the financial chain reaction is not. **Sereno was built to bridge the gap** between these operational realities and your financial bottom line.

## Precision cover designed for real operational exposure.

### Traditional insurance struggles with the "short-and-sharp" nature of maritime delays.

Sereno MGA uses high-resolution data and real operational indices—rather than vague monthly averages—to create a dedicated maritime cover that responds the moment the weather impacts your site.

## Where we provide the most value

### Tailored parametric solutions for every player in the maritime logistics chain.

{% simple_grid(count="3") %}

{% feature_card(title="Port & Terminal Operators", subtitle="", icon="building", tags=["Crane downtime protection", "Berth congestion cover", "Weather pattern monitoring"]) %}
Protect your margins against crane downtime and berth congestion caused by convective weather patterns and wind shear.
{% end %}

{% feature_card(title="Shipping Lines & Charterers", subtitle="", icon="ship", tags=["Demurrage cost offset", "Queue delay coverage", "Standing cost protection"]) %}
Mitigate the financial sting of weather-driven demurrage. When a vessel is stuck in the queue due to a port closure, Sereno provides the liquidity to cover the daily standing costs.
{% end %}

{% feature_card(title="Bulk Handlers", subtitle="", icon="package", tags=["Cargo contamination cover", "Loading delay protection", "Discharge interruption"]) %}
Manage the risk of "sludge" or cargo contamination. If sudden heavy rain stops loading/discharging, our cover compensates for the resulting operational delays.

{% end %}

## From Abidjan to Antwerp: High-resolution protection.

The atmosphere is changing. A warmer climate produces sharper contrasts and more frequent "micro-events" that tilt operations into demurrage cycles. Sereno leverages global weather data integrated with your specific port coordinates.
