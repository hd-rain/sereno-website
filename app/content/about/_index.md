# About Sereno

Sereno was built with a clear vision: bring transparency to the insurance world and elevate parametric solutions to help businesses manage the financial impact of weather events across all industries.

**As climate volatility increases, too many risks remain poorly covered, misunderstood, or excluded.**

We believe insurance should be simple to understand, grounded in science, and designed to deliver predictable financial outcomes when it matters most.

That is what Sereno is built to do.
