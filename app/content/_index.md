## Tech add value for your customers

_More than policies—a complete platform to monitor your clients' exposure._

{% simple_grid_with_image(image_1="/images/assessment.webp", alt_1="A screenshot of risk assessment from our platform", image_2="/images/monitoring.webp", alt_2="A screenshot of risk monitoring from our platform") %}

{% feature_card(title="Portfolio‑level monitoring", subtitle="See the bigger picture.", icon="activity") %}

The platform gives you a clear view across your portfolio:

- Active covers and limits
- Exposure by region or peril
- Events in progress and potential payouts

You gain visibility to support better advice, stronger renewals, and more strategic conversations.

{% end %}

{% feature_card(title="Client‑specific triggers", subtitle="No generic assumptions.", icon="bell") %}

Triggers are designed using your clients’ own exposure data.Thresholds are calibrated to real locations, assets, and risk profiles, ensuring a clear link between:

- The weather event
- The trigger
- The client’s financial exposure

This precision reduces basis risk and builds trust.

{% end %}

{% feature_card(title="Proactive alerts for your clients", subtitle="Stay ahead of climate events.", icon="target") %}

We monitor weather conditions in real time and send alerts:

- When a relevant event is forecasted
- As conditions evolve toward predefined thresholds
- When thresholds are reached or exceeded

You can inform your clients early and act before impacts materialize.
